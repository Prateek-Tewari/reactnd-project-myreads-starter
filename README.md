# MyReads Project

This is Udacity's ReactND project which is appropriately named <strong>MyReads-A Book Tracking App</strong>.
Here you can keep track of the books you read,you want to read or currently reading.
The app perfectly saves state and it will let you start from the last time. Isn't it cool???

You can mark any book under any category and it will show that category right there in your homepage or at any place you see that book within the app,the chosen category will be shown.
